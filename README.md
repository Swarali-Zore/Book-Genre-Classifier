# Book-Genre-Classification

This project focuses on classifying books into different genres based on their textual metadata such as title, description, and/or author information. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict the genre of a book from given textual inputs.

---

## Project Objectives
- Process and analyze book-related textual data.
- Train and evaluate classification models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest.
- Achieve accurate multi-class predictions for genres like Fiction, Romance, Fantasy, Horror, History, and more.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** – data handling
- **Scikit-learn**, **TfidfVectorizer**
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** – visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** – development

---

## Dataset
The dataset contains book titles, descriptions/summaries, authors, and corresponding genres.

### Preprocessing Steps:
- Text cleaning (removal of punctuation, lowercase conversion)
- Tokenization and stopword removal
- TF-IDF vectorization

## Model Performance
Several models were trained and evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score

The best-performing model was selected based on validation metrics.
