# Book-Genre-Classification
Book Genre Classification using Machine Learning
This project focuses on classifying books into different genres based on their textual metadata such as title, description, and/or author information. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict the genre of a book from given textual inputs.

Project Objectives
To process and analyze book-related textual data.

To train and evaluate classification models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest.

To achieve accurate multi-class predictions for common genres like Fiction, Romance, Fantasy, Horror, History, and more.

Technologies Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy for data handling

Scikit-learn, TfidfVectorizer for modeling

Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization

Jupyter Notebook for development

Dataset
The dataset contains book titles, descriptions/summaries, authors, and corresponding genres. Data preprocessing includes:

Cleaning and tokenization

Removing stop words and punctuation

TF-IDF vectorization


Model Performance
Multiple machine learning models were trained and evaluated using classification metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The best performing model was selected based on validation results.
